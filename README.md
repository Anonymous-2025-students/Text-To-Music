## **Features**
- Transform text descriptions into music.
- Fine-tuned models optimized for accurate text-to-music transformations.
- Pre-processed datasets for easy reproducibility.
- Scalable pipeline for training and evaluation.

---

## **Dataset**
The project uses datasets from Hugging Face to train and fine-tune the model for music generation. You can explore and download the datasets from the following link:

[ðŸŽµ Explore Music Datasets on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets?search=music)

- **Source:** Hugging Face Datasets
- **Description:** A collection of datasets containing textual and musical data for training text-to-music generation models.

> Note: Ensure you preprocess the dataset as required before using it for training.

- **Preprocessing Details:** Data was tokenized and aligned with audio features for effective model training.

### Instructions for Checkpoint Setup
1. Download the above checkpoints from their respective links.
2. Place the downloaded files in the appropriate directories as per the project structure:
   - `FLAN-T5`: `models/flan_t5/`
   - `CLAP`: `models/clap/`
   - `RoBERTa`: `models/roberta/`
3. Update the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to include the paths to the checkpoints and dataset.
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the model.
